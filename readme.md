### About this Project

The roller skating community is connected by the common interest in finding different ways to move on roller skates.  This application taps into the roller skating community's interest in sharing things they've learned to to on their skates, and looking for new challenges.

The Roller Skate Trick Library is a community-driven collection of tricks people can do on roller skates.  Contributors are able to add, edit, and delete their contributions. The library includes a profiles feature where contributors can share the library tricks they have accomplished.  Contributors can also share information about their roller skates.

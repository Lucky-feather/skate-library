# Roller Skate Trick Library

## [See The Library Here ðŸ›¼](https://roller-skate-library.fly.dev/)

### About this Project

The roller skating community is connected by the common interest in finding different ways to move on roller skates.  This application taps into the roller skating community's practice of sharing things they've learned to do on their skates, as well as provides an avenue to discover new challenges and ways to increase their skills.

**The Roller Skate Trick Library** is a community-driven collection of tricks people can do on roller skates.  Contributors are able to add, edit, and delete their contributions. The library includes a profiles feature where contributors can share the library tricks they have accomplished.  Contributors can also share information about their roller skates.

### Getting Started
The library itself can be viewed as a guest to the site. In order to contribute to the library and view other users' profiles, a user must log in with a google account.

This is an application that is likely to be used on a phone, so responsive design is something I took into consideration.

### Ice Box items:
- As a user I want to delete tricks from my 'Unlocked' list.
- As a user I would like to be able to add links to youtube or instagram videos along with description of my tricks.
- As a user I would like to be able to comment on other people's tricks. 
- As a user I would like to be able to organize tricks in the library based on the type of skating they involve, such as dance moves, or skate park skills.



I hope you enjoy this application as much as I enjoy roller skating.
